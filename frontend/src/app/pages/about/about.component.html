          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2023, DonorConnect was born from a simple idea: what if giving could be
            more engaging, transparent, and rewarding? Our founders experienced firsthand the
            disconnect between donors and the causes they support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we've grown into a thriving community of over 10,000 donors who have
            collectively contributed more than $500,000 to causes worldwide. But we're just
            getting started.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every day, we work to build features that make giving more meaningful – from
            real-time impact tracking to gamification elements that celebrate your generosity.
